This is a SeisFlows Test workflow class which is used to test out the underlying
`System` machinery for a given set of modules.

TestFlow is intended for development and debugging purposes. It is used to 
ensure that these tasks are not done on large-scale, compute-intensive jobs.

    """
    TestFlow Workflow
    -----------------
    Test individual sub-modules in a 'live' testing environment in order to
    ensure SeisFlows works appropriately given an established system and solver.

    Current functionality:
        - Submit a test function ('hello world') to the System
        - Monitor job queue for successful job completion
        - Submit an intentionally failing job and catch job failure

    .. note::

        You do not need to set System parameters `ntask`, `nproc`, `tasktime`,
        `walltime`. These will be overwritten by the setup task.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Paths
    -----

    :param path_output: path to directory used for permanent storage on disk.
