"""
A seismic inversion (a.k.a full waveform inversion, adjoint tomography, full
waveform tomography) perturbs seismic velocity models by minimizing objective
functions defining differences between observed and synthetic waveforms.

This seismic inversion workflow performs a linear set of tasks involving:

1) Generating synthetic seismograms using an external numerical solver
2) Calculating time-dependent misfit (adjoint sources) between data
    (or other synthetics) and synthetics
3) Using adjoint sources to generate misfit kernels defining volumetric
    perturbations sensitive to data-synthetic misfit
4) Smoothing and summing misfit kernels into a single gradient
5) Perturbing the starting model with the gradient to reduce misfit defined by
    the objective function during a line search

The Inversion workflow runs the above tasks in a loop (iterations) while
exporting updated models, kernels and/or gradients to disk.
