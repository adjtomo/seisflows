"""
The Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is a commonly used
workload manager on many high performance computers / clusters. The Slurm
system class provides generalized utilites for interacting with Slurm systems.

Useful commands for figuring out system-specific required parameters
    $ sinfo --Node --long  # Determine the cores-per-node for partitions

.. note::
    The main development system for SeisFlows used SLURM. Therefore the other
    system supers will not be up to date until access to those systems are
    granted. This rosetta stone, for converting from SLURM to other workload
    management tools will be useful: https://slurm.schedmd.com/rosetta.pdf

.. note::
   SLURM systems expect walltime/tasktime in format: "minutes", 
   "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds". SeisFlows uses the latter
   and converts task and walltimes from input of minutes to a time string.

TODO
    Create 'slurm_singulairty', a child class for singularity-based runs which
    loads and runs programs through singularity, OR add a parameter options
    which will change the run and/or submit calls
