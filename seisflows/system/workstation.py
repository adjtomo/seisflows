class Workstation:
    """
    Workstation System [System Base]
    --------------------------------
    Defines foundational structure for System module. When used standalone,
    runs solver tasks either in serial (if `nproc`==1; i.e., without MPI) or in
    parallel (if `nproc`>1; i.e., with MPI). All other tasks are run in serial.

    Parameters
    ----------
    :type ntask: int
    :param ntask: number of individual tasks/events to run during workflow.
        Must be <= the number of source files in `path_specfem_data`
    :type nproc: int
    :param nproc: number of processors to use for each simulation. Choose 1 for
        serial simulations, and `nproc`>1 for parallel simulations.
    :type tasktime: float
    :param tasktime: maximum job time in units minutes for each job spawned by
        the SeisFlows master job during a workflow. These include, e.g.,
        running the forward solver, adjoint solver, smoother, kernel combiner.
        All spawned tasks receive the same task time. Fractions of minutes
        acceptable. If set as `None`, no tasktime will be enforced.
    :type mpiexec: str
    :param mpiexec: MPI executable on system. Defaults to 'mpirun -n ${NPROC}'
    :type array: str
    :param array: for `ntask` > 1, determine which tasks to submit to run. By
        default (NoneType) this submits all task IDs [0:ntask), or for single
        runs, submits only the first task ID, 0. However, for debugging or
        manual control purposes, Users may input a string of task IDs that they
        would like to run. Follows formatting of SLURM array directive
        (https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html), which is, for example:
        1,2,3-8:2,10 -> 1,2,3,5,7,10
        where '-' denotes a range (inclusive), and ':' denotes an optional step.
        If ':' step is not given for a range, then step defaults to 1.
    :type rerun: int
    :param rerun: [EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE] attempt to re-run failed tasks or 
        array tasks submitted with `run`. Collects information about failed 
        jobs (or array jobs) after a failure, and re-submits with `run`. 
        `rerun` is an integer defining how many times the User wants System to
        try and rerun before failing the entire job. If 0 (default), a single
        task failure will cause main job failure.
    :type log_level: str
    :param log_level: logger level to pass to logging module.
        Available: 'debug', 'info', 'warning', 'critical'
    :type verbose: bool
    :param verbose: if True, formats the log messages to include the file
        name and line number of the log message in the source code, as well as 
        the message and message type. Useful for debugging but also very verbose
        so not recommended for production runs.

    Paths
    -----
    :type path_output_log: str
    :param path_output_log: path to a text file used to store the outputs of
        the package wide logger, which are also written to stdout
    :type path_par_file: str
    :param path_par_file: path to parameter file which is used to instantiate
        the package
    :type path_log_files: str
    :param path_log_files: path to a directory where individual log files are
        saved whenever a number of parallel tasks are run on the system.
