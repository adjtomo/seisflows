SeisFlows
=========

SeisFlows is an open source seismic inversion package that provides

- A customizable waveform inversion workflow

- A framework for research in regional, global, and exploration seismology

SeisFlows differs from previous open-source software in emphasizing both flexibility and HPC portability.  Examples and usage information are available at [readthedocs.org](http://seisflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  Probably the easiest way to learn more is to follow these checkerboard example [instructions](http://seisflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instructions_remote.html).


Design
------
With SeisFlows, the inversion task is abstracted into six components: `solver`, `system`, `nonlinear optimization`, `data preprocessing`, `postprocessing`, and `workflow`.  This design is informed by hands-on experience with different HPC environments and research applications. The source code is structured in a modular way based on these six categories, and users are offered various choices in each one.  To see the choices available for each category, simply browse the source code.  The inversion itself is executed by `seisflows/workflow/inversion.py`, which may be good place to start looking.

Wave simulations are performed by calling an external solver. The ability to interface with outside packages provides flexibility, and the choice of SPECFEM2D/3D/3D\_GLOBE as default options gives optional GPU acceleration and other useful capabilities. Setting up your own inversions, however, can be time consuming because it requires familiarity with SPECFEM2D/3D/3D\_GLOBES's idiosyncratic meshing procedure and binary file formats. Alternatively, some users have interfaced with other solvers, but this can also be time consuming.
