SeisFlows3 is a fork of [SeisFlows](https://github.com/rmodrak/seisflows/) and the [current main development branch](https://github.com/rmodrak/seisflows/issues/111) for this codebase. 

SeisFlows is a Python-based waveform inversion package used to tackle the problems of full waveform inversion, seismic migration, and adjoint tomography.  
                                                                                 
With a growing user base in academia and industry, this package has been used for production scale inversions, some with over a billion model parameters, for research problems related to oil and gas exploration, earthquake seismology, and general nonlinear optimization problems.                                         
                                                                                 
Changes made in the SeisFlows3 package include code refactor to Python3, improvements in source-code implementation and readability, stronger adherance to coding standards (PEP-8), and additional functionalities not present in the original package.
