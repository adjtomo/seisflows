SeisFlows
=========

SeisFlows is a Python-based waveform inversion package used to tackle the problems of full waveform inversion, seismic migration, and adjoint tomography.  
                                                                                 
With a growing user base in academia and industry, this package has been used for production scale inversions, some with over a billion model parameters, for research problems related to oil and gas exploration, earthquake seismology, and general nonlinear optimization problems.                                         
                                                                                 
SeisFlows3 is a fork of SeisFlows and the current main development branch. Changes to the package include migration to Python3, updates to source-code readability through improved doc strings and comments, stronger adherance to PEP-8 standards, and additional functionalities not present in the original package.
