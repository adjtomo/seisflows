Background
----------
The most sophisticated full-waveform inversion packages are expensive, proprietary software developed by major oil and gas companies and geophysical service providers.  Generally, such software is maintained by professional development teams and not available to independent researchers.

Outside of industry, several open source packages have been developed, mainly in geophysics but also in nondestructive testing and other fields.  Many early inversion packages use frequency-domain formulations suitable for research, but not scalable beyond inexpensive 2D problems.  More recent packages such as SeisFlows use Python for inexpensive processing tasks in combination with parallel compiled code for wave simulation.  This approach combines the ease of use of modern scientific Python and with the efficiency and scalability of modern acoustic and elastic wave-equation solvers.

SeisFlows has an idiosyncratic workflow-based design informed by familiarity with diverse research problems (oil and gas exploration, earthqake tomography, medical imaging) and experience running in diverse environments (laptops, desktops, and a variety of high-performance computing clusters).

With SeisFlows, wave simulations must be performed using an external software packagesuch as SPECFEM2D or SPECFEM3D.  The ability to interface with external solvers ensures flexibility.  The choice of SPECFEM2D/3D for the default solver interfaces creates an opportunity to take advantage of cutting-edge meshing and hardware accelaration capabilities.

At the same time, the need for an external solver creates additional work for the user.  To carry out an inversion, one must become familiar not only with SeisFlows, but also with a separate solver package.  If you decide to try SeisFlows, it should be fairly straightforward to run the checkerboard and Marmousi examples available at [readthedocs.org](http://seisflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  To move beyond these examples, one would need to become familiar with how to set up simulations with SPECFEM2D/3D, and in paricular, with how to create models in SPECFEM2D/3D's idionsyncratic binary format.
