SeisFlows
=========

SeisFlows is an open source seismic inversion package that

- Delivers a customizable waveform inversion workflow

- Provides a framework for research in regional, global, and exploration seismology

Examples and usage information are available at [readthedocs.org](http://seisflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  Probably the easiest way to learn more is to follow these checkerboard example [instructions](http://seisflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instructions_remote.html).

Design
------
The inversion task is abstracted into six components: solver, system, nonlinear optimization, data preprocessing, image postprocessing, and workflow.  This design is informed by hands-on experience with many different high-performance computing environments and research applications (including oil and gas exploration, earthquake tomography, and ultrasound imaging).  

To see the choices available for each component, simply browse the source code and note the modules available in each of the six directories.  The inversion itself is executed by `inversion.main` in `seisflows/workflow/inversion.py`, which may be another good place to browse.
