SeisFlows is an open-source, Python-based waveform inversion package that tackles the problems of full waveform inversion, seismic migration, and adjoint tomography. 

With a user base in both academia and industry, this package has been used for production scale inversions, some with over a billion model parameters, for research problems related to oil and gas exploration, earthquake seismology and general nonlinear optimization problems.
