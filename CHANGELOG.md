# CHANGELOG

## v3.4.0 (#228)
- Solver now allows input of list of parameters rather than using pre-defined labels to select. 
- Moved all parameters setup and check tasks into the main Specfem solver module, rather than having it be distributed around the child classes
- New material label '2D_ANISOTROPIC' for SPECFEM2D C_ij anisotropy definition
- Bugfix: `Optimize` module now kills workflow if maximum allowable steplength exceeded. Previously the workflow would just evaluate the same capped step length until `step_count_max` was exceeded

## v3.3.0 (#227)
- Updates for System class Wisteria
- Overhauled `Fujitsu` System class to now allow parameter `ntask_max`. This is not an inherent option in Fujitsu-brand clusters so I needed to code it up directly in SeisFlows. General architecture is that SeisFlows submits `ntask_max` jobs to the System and monitors them, whenever a job completes, a new job is submitted to take its place, until `ntask` jobs have completed.
- Replace some default module loading in Wisteria custom run scripts to not use CUDA-aware MPI as this is not used in SPECFEM3D_Cartesian
- Shifted `residuals` directory creation into the responsibility of Workflow module, rather than preprocessing module, to keep dir. creation high-level
- Bugfix: Default preprocessing was not correctly attributing event origin time to synthetics which causes waveform timing mismatch when using real data (this was okay for synthetics because they both then had default timing)
- Bugfix: SPECFEM solver `nproc` check because there is a case where mpiexec gets defined to a default value for the system (if assigned NoneType), leading to serial runs when the User is expecting MPI processes. This is a redundant check to the System check
- Preprocessing modules (both Default and Pyaflowa) improved error logging
- Renamed log files for individual solver directories for `xgenerate_databases` as these were the same as the mesher (mesher -> database)

## v3.2.10
- Hotfix: system Chinook was only using 1 core for single jobs which is not enough for combine_sem and smooth operations (but okay for xcombine_vol_data_vtk)

## v3.2.9
- Hotfix: bugfix SPECFEM solver Model class throwing assertion error for model arrays that were all 0,
  which can happen with fully anisotropic materials

## v3.2.8 (#225)
- Changes `materials` input `ANISOTROPIC` to `TRANVERSE_ISOTROPIC` to differentiate from general anisotropy
- `TRANSVERSE_ISOTROPIC` available for both SPECFEM3D and SPECFEM3D_GLOBE with expected parameters: vsh, vsv, vph, vpv, eta
- Introduces new `materials` input `ANISOTROPIC` to use 21 component anisotropy C_ij, iff `solver`==`specfem3d`
- Adds some solver checks and warnings around `materials`==`ANISOTROPIC`

## v3.2.7 (6afdd56)
- Noise inversion thrifty bugfix not evaluating misfit properly due to incorrect bool check

## v3.2.6 (#224)
- Adds better traceback information when Pyaflowa preprocessing tasks fail

## v3.2.5 (#222)
- Fixes logs and figures getting deleted but not saved during Pyaflowa finalization
- Changes finalization behavior to not delete logs/figures from scratch directory, if User requests no export
- Removes hardcoded tasktime increase for postprocessing tasks which was accidentally left in from development

## v3.2.4 (#221)
- Fixes synthetic inversion data generation for noise inversion workflow
- Fixes some flag misnaming in Forward workflow synthetic inversion data generation
- Adjusts main log message aesthetics to provide a visual marker for new job submissions

## v3.2.3 (#218)
- Bugfix Fujitsu/Wisteria environ variable was being updated internally, causing an accumulating error
- Removed Pyaflowa preprocess normalization step as this was hardcoded for some research tasks, not meant to be in code
- Added a tasktime multiplier to Inversion kernel postprocessing tasks, eventually this should be accessible via the State system or parameter file but for now making it part of the source code
- Removes main install instruction pointing to Pyatoa GitHub, points to PyPi now by default
- Updates [dev] install instructions to point towards GitHub rather than PyPi versions. Dev install instructions are now:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .[dev]  # to install dev branches 
  ```

## v3.2.2 
- Hotfix: update cli tool 'plotst' to reflect import structure changes 

## v3.2.1 (#214)
- Model class now saves internal model representation as 'object' arrays to deal with chunks of differing lengths
- Model .npz files are now saved as pickle files
- Update and improve tests to cover Model class

## v3.2.0 (#213)

### Major
- **New parameter**: `optimize.step_len_min` allows the User to set a minimum step length (alpha) as a percentage of the model values. This prevents line searches from trying to minimize misfit with very small model changes, which is a waste of computational resources. 
- **Changed Behavior**: Saved Forward arrays are now overwritten by new forward simulations, for the case when Thrifty line searches need access to forward arrays in subsequent adjoint simulations
- **QoL Improvement**: Initial and True model file export (tied to parameter `export_model`) now checks whether files exist and will not overwrite (previously they always overwrote), meaning Solver.setup() is now a lot faster
- **Bugfix**: Preprocess.Pyaflowa was missing a `mkdir` for adjoint source directory which was leading to FileNotFoundError
- **Examples**: Changed starting step length in Ex1 to achieve successful line search. Ex2 does NOT finish iteration, will need to fix this

### Minor
- Workflow Thrifty checks are now inside a property that can be checked, rather than as a function call
- Preprocess reads STATION metadata (locations) from it's Event's own 'DATA' directory (e.g., scratch/solver/001/DATA/STATIONS), rather than from the master station file (e.g., path_specfem_data/STATIONS), allowing for different STATION definitions for different events. Untested, might need a little more tooling to make that work.
- New internal Workflow.Inversion attribute `_was_thrifty` keeps track of whether a previous iteration's finalization was done in a Thrifty manner, allowing the current iteration to skip forward simulations. **WARNING** This parameter is NOT saved to disk, so if the workflow breaks between finalization of iteration I and forward simulations of I+1, then forward simulations will be run like a normal inversion.
- Cleaned up the aesthetic look of Submit and Debug commands
- Removed `step_len_max` from Line Search instantiation because it was not used by the module
- Refactored some optimization checks for `step_len_min` and `step_len_max` with better log messages and less redundant code
- Removed `path_specfem_data` from Preprocess init because it is not used in the module
- Removed some redundant checks from Preprocess (Default and Pyaflowa)
- Removed STATION file reading from default preprocessing as the Inventory was not used

## v3.1.1 (#212)
Small PR for some inconsistencies causing the examples to not work. 

- Missing solver parameter `prune_scratch` causing SPECFEM2D to fail
- Incorrect boolean check causing forward workflow to fail
- Bump Devel version number 3.1.0 -> 3.1.1

## v3.1.0 (#208)
Bugfix NoiseInversion Workflow 

### Main Fix
- Solver defines filename wildcards for requisite forward array files that are used for adjoint simulations. These are used to save forward arrays during noise inversion workflow
- Solver.forward_simulation() now has new parameter `save_forward_arrays` that User can use to specify location to save arrays relative to the solver working directory. Should not be required for other workflows
- Solver.adjoint_simulation() now has the ability to `load_forward_arrays` by specifying path which should correspond to the forward simulation save_forward_arrays parameter. 
- Solver.adjoint_simulation() has the ability to `del_loaded_forward_arrays` to free up memory after adjoint simulation completes successfully
- 
### Misc.
- Solver executables for each version of SPECFEM (2D/3D/3D_GLOBE) are now defined as internal variables in `__init__` rather than at the top of each corresponding function, making it clearer and easier to overwrite 
- API Change: change default directory name `path_data=='waveforms'` (previously 'data') to avoid confusion with SPECFEM DATA/ directory and SeisFlows SFDATA/ directory. 
- Workflow.NoiseInversion class now check sfor correct SPECFEM parameter that mandates using forcesolutions
- Work In Progress: Started writing machinery for generating combined adjoint kernel but this is incomplete and will throw a NotImplementedError
- Preprocess modules now logs a 'completed' statement to make it clear that the process has finished successfully
- Modified additional log messages for brevity or to stand out more in the main log file


## v3.0.2 (#204)
System Wisteria GPU Upgrades

- Bugfix: Fujitsu tasktime for individual job submission was using `walltime` value, not `tasktime` value
- Combined and condensed main System functionality in Fujitsu system from Wisteria child class. Prior to this Wisteria child class was overwriting most of the functionality of Fujitsu which is not really the point of inheritance
- New Custom Run and Submit scriopts for Wisteria GPU. Better comments and slightly easier to modify for others
- Added new `rscgrps` to include GPU partitions on Wisteria
- Improved run call header for easier switching between CPU and GPU nodes

## v3.0.1 (#203) 
Quality of Life Updates

- Solver now automatically generates VTK files for Models and Gradients at the end of each iteration
    - New function `solver.specfem.make_output_vtk_files` that generates .vtk files for all files in the output/ directory
    - solver.finalize() runs `make_output_vtk_files` at the end of each iteration
    - new solver parameter `export_vtk` controls whether the above option is run, default to True, only available for SPECFEM3D/3D_GLOBE
- Improve organization for files exported to `path_output` 
    - Optimization stats file and figures saved the `workdir/output/optimize` whereas before they were saved directly to output/
    - Changed pyaflowa export directory to `workdir/output/preprocess` (before it was `workdir/output/pyaflowa`)
- Quality of Life Updates
    - `path_data` directory is deleted by `seisflows clean` iff empty, since it is created by solver.setup()
    - Logging updates: better visual demarcation of workflow tasks, headers relate to workflow function run
    - `seisflows debug` has a cleaner log message
    - shuffled workflow finalization procedures so that base class (forward) contains standard finalization procedures
- Bugfix
    - Uncommented gll model check which had been commented for devel purposes

## v3.0.0
- Workflow:
    - State file changed states from words to integers (completed -> 1, 
      failed -> -1, pending -> 0), and full state file is created at workflow
      setup, rather than one by one as each function completes
    - Inversion:
        - **Changed total misfit summation from summed + squared to L1 norm.**
        - Line search has been broken into multiple functions to facilitate
          restarting failed line searches: 
          perform_line_search() -> evaluate_line_search_misfit() + update_line_search()
    - NoiseInversion:
        - **Modifies the Inversion class to invert for ZZ, RR and TT empirical 
          Green's functions**
        - Utility function to rotate EE, EN, NE, NN waveforms to RR and TT
        - Utility function to rotate RR and TT adjoint sources to EE, EN, NE, NN
        - Utility function to convert STATIONS file to N SOURCE files since 
          virtual sources are required for ambient noise adjoint tomography
        - Functionality to create a source-receiver lookup table that contains
          information on azimuth + backazimuth required for RR/TT kernels
- Preprocessing:
    - Default (major upgrades)
        - Force 'obs' data to match 'syn' data sampling rate
        - **Parallelized misfit quantification with concurrent futures**
        - Zero'd adjoint source generation now occurs at module setup 
          (parallelized)
        - Added additional normalization options
        - Allows selection by component for misfit quantification
        - Improved obs-syn file match validation
        - Removed the ability to `sum_residuals`, which required Preprocess to 
          know too many things about the workflow. Now handled by Workflow.
        - **Added a simple waveform plotter to show obs, syn and adjoint source**
        - Split off preprocessing functions (mute, normalize) to `tools` which
          Preprocess can import
    - Pyaflowa
        - Removed `client` parameter to match Pyatoa > 0.3.0
        - Allow processing only for specific components
        - Data reading abstraction simplified, no longer builds paths from parts
          but instead explcitely reads data + metadata like Default preproc.
        - **Pyflex preset now directly part of parameter file so that User can
          edit them directly**
- System:
    - General:
        - `tasktime` now set in the top parent class
        - Allow custom tasktimes for functions run with `System.run`
        - **`rerun` function tells System to re-run failed jobs some number of 
          times to deal with randomly failing tasks that usually work once you
          run them again**; added to TestFlow
    - Cluster (and derived classes):
        - **New parameter `array`: For debug purposes, allow running only specific
          task IDs to e.g., re-run failed processes. Input style follows SLURM
          array argument** 
        - **Submit jobs directly to the login node with the -l/--login flag**
        - Non-zero exit code error catching added to concurrent future calls
        - **Overhauled job monitoring system. Notably, does not break on first  
          job failure, but rather to wait until all jobs are finished. Tied into System `rerun` feature**
    - Slurm (and derived classes): 
        - Added a timeout counter and extended timeout value for checking
          output of `sacct` for queue checking due to premature job exits with
          empty `sacct` returns (i.e., it takes a while for compute nodes to 
          spin up and be visible in `sacct`)
- Optimize:
    - Major reorganization, breaking major monolithic functions into smaller pieces
    - Improved function and checkpoint order with the intent of easier failure recovery
    - Internal restart and revert functions for manually stepping back failed line searches
- Solver: 
    - API change: solver.combine() made more generic and no longer hardcodes
      assumed directory structure
    - Parameter change: `density` -> `update_density`
    - Model parameter checks removed from Solver's abilities. These are now 
      handled by Workflow
    - Takes over responsibility for renaming adjoint sources 
    - Takes over responsibility for obs-syn filename matching prior to preproc.
- Command Line Tool:
    - `seisflows submit --login` -> `seisflows submit --direct` for submitting
      your workflow directly to the login/home node and not to a cluster node
    - `seisflows configure` makes more clear which paths are default/not 
      important, and which paths are required
    - `seisflows setup` <-> `seisflows init` namespace change as the names make
      more sense in this order. `init` starts a blank working directory, `setup`
      runs module setup functions (like directory creation)
- New Dependencies: 
    - PyPDF: for PDF mergers in Pyaflowa preprocessing
    - PySEP: for SPECFEM-specific read functions 

### Minor Changes
- Solver: 
    - Parallelized directory initialization w/ concurrent futures
    - Kernel renaming defined as a separate function (previously part of 
      adjoint simulation), so that it can be called by debugger
- Optimization:
    - Improves step length overwrite log messaging
    - Skips initial line search calculation if initial step length requested
- Workflow: Allow other workflows to overwrite the default location where 
  synthetic waveforms are saved
- System: improved file system management by organizing spawned process log files
  and removing scratch/system directory each iteration
- Preprocessing Pyaflowa: improved output file management, export and removal 
- Model checking now occurs in Workflow rather than Solver functions
- **Workflow data preparation now symlinks in real data rather than copies it,
  to avoid heavy file overhead**
- **Removed unnused `graphics` utilities and adopted all of Pyatoa's PNG and PDF
  image manipulation utilities for use in Pyaflowa preprocessing (adds PyPDF as
  dependency)**
- Removed large sections of commented out code from command line tool
- Single source version number in `pyproject.toml`
- **Logger aesthetic change to show first four letters of message type rather than
  first letter (e.g., I -> INFO, W -> WARN, D -> DEBU)**
- **Model parameter check now includes mean values in addition to min and max**
- **New CLI tool: `seisflows print tasks` to get source names and relevant task ID**
- Model tool now breaks on check if any NaNs present in model arrays
- `Optimize`: split up some internal functions for easier separation of tasks 
  that were previously all mashed together

### Bugfixes
- **Major: SPECFEM3D_GLOBE based solvers were NOT updating the model during 
  Inversion workflows ecause `xmeshfem3D` was not being called, and therefore 
  not updating database files.**
- **Pyaflowa was checking the incorrect values for windows returned from Manager 
  causing incorrect misfit calculation and an inability for the inversion to reduce misfit**
- **Cross-correlation Traveltime misfit function was not squared, allowing CC 
  values to be negative. Now follows Tromp (2005) where we square the time shift**
- `mpiexec` was being set inside System initiation, causing check statement to 
  fail quietly
- System.Cluster.Run now passes User-defined arguments for log level and 
  verbosity to each child process allowing for uniform logs for all jobs
- `seisflows swap` allow paths to be set relative or absolute, previously they
  were forced to absolute
- Old Optimization files (e.g., m\_old) were not being deleted due to missing 
  file extensions. Not critical because they were not used, and overwritten
- **`seisflows setpar` was not properly setting FORTRAN double precision values. 
  Added some better catches for `setpar` as it was quietly failing when files
  were nonexistent**
- LBFGS line search restart `step_count_max` was not being evaluated properly
- `seisflows configure` will no longer try to configure an already configured   
  file
- **Concurrency: better all-around error catching for any functions that are 
  parallelized by concurrent futures. Previously these functions failed quietly**
- solver.specfem3d_globe was not recognizing custom model types

### Misc.
- Removed hard requirement that `import_seisflows` required all Workflows have
  `modules` as their first argument. Only Forward workflow requires.
- Removed Optimize load checkpoint from inversion setup because it was already
  run by Optimize setup
