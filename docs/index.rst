Examples: Available For Download
--------------------------------

We have prepared a 2D waveform inversion example that is inexpensive enough to run on almost any laptop, desktop, or cluster. To run this simple checkboard inversion, see these step-by-step :doc:`instructions <instructions_remote>`. 

Some additional examples are available for download.  Please review the instructions for the 2D checkerboard test case to get a sense for how to run these other inversions.

Some 2D examples based on the Marmousi model are available `here <http://tigress-web.princeton.edu/~rmodrak/2dElastic>`_.

A 3D Cartesian checkerboard example is available `here <http://tigress-web.princeton.edu/~rmodrak/3dElastic>`_.

A 3D global 1-chunk example is available `here <http://tigress-web.princeton.edu/~rmodrak/ExamplesGlobal>`_. Please note, the compressed archive for this example is very large (> 0.5 GB). [No longer available because of file size.]

At a minimimum, one processer is required for the 2D Marmousi examples, 16 processors are required for the 3D Cartesian example, and 64 processors are required for the global 1-chunk example.  See `here <http://seisflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage/usage.html#system-configuration>`_ for more information about running inversions in parallel.
