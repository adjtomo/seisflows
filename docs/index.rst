SeisFlows --- Automated Inversion Software
==========================================

`SeisFlows <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows>`__  is an open-source,
Python-based waveform inversion package meant to automate the problems of full
waveform inversion, seismic migration, and adjoint tomography on high
performance computers.

SeisFlows is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows>`__ as
part of the `adjTomo organization <https://github.com/adjtomo/>`__.

---------------------------------

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Check out the `Overview page <overview.html>`__ to learn about SeisFlows and
  how to use it.
- Found a bug or want to request a new feature? Feel free to
  `open a GitHub Issue! <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows/issues>`__
- Want to talk about SeisFlows?
  `Check in on the discussions page. <https://github.com/orgs/adjtomo/discussions>`__
- Contributions are encouranged and welcome! Have a look at the 
  `adjTomo Contributor's Guide <https://pyatoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`__  to see how you can contribute (hosted on Pyatoa's docs).


---------------------------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install SeisFlows and its dependencies, we recommend installing within
a Conda environment to not affect your root environment. The 
`master <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows/>`__ branch contains the most
stable release and is the preferred installation branch. The 
`devel <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows/tree/devel>`__ branch houses 
the most up-to-date codebase, but is likely to be **unstable**.

.. note::

    SeisFlows is installed using the Pip ``-e`` which enables development
    mode, where source code changes are immediately acccessible to Python (i.e.,
    you do **not** need to re-install SeisFlows when updating source code).

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows.git
   cd seisflows
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate seisflows

Alternative: update an existing environment
```````````````````````````````````````````

The above installation instructions create a **new** Conda environment named 
`seisflows`. If you have an *existing* Conda environment and want to install 
SeisFlows and it's dependencies there, you can run the following:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows.git             
    cd seisflows 
    conda activate <your environment>
    conda env update --name <your environment> --file environment.yml
