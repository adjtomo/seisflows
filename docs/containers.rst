SeisFlows in Containers
=======================

As part of the `NSF-funded SCOPED project
<https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2104052>`__ SeisFlows has
been containerized using `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__, which removes the
oftentimes troubling task of installing and configuring software. These
containers can be used to run SeisFlows on workstations (using Docker) or
on high performance computers using
`Singularity/Apptainer <https://apptainer.org/>`__.

.. note::
    The SeisFlows Docker image can be found here:
    https://github.com/SeisSCOPED/pyatoa

.. note::
    The `Pyatoa` container is shipped with the latest versions of
    `SeisFlows <https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows>`__,
    `Pyatoa <https://github.com/adjtomo/pyatoa>`__,
    `PySEP <https://github.com/uafgeotools/pysep>`__.

The remainder of this documentation page assumes you are familiar with Docker
and containers. To learn more about Docker and containers you can visit:

Workstation example with Docker
-------------------------------

Here we will step through how running the
`SeisFlows-SPECFEM2D <specfem2d_example.html>`__ example using the available
Docker image.

To get the latest version of the `Pyatoa` Docker image, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull ghcr.io/seisscoped/pyatoa:nightly

Their are two methods for running the SeisFlows example using this Docker image,
either through a `JupyterHub interface <https://jupyter.org/hub>`__, or through
the command line. The former provides a graphical user interface that mimics
a virtual desktop for easier navigation, while the latter provides more
flexibility for scripting and using SeisFlows as a research tool.

From JupyterHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can run SeisFlows through JupyterHub by running through a port:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/seisscoped/pyatoa:nightly

To open the running JupyterHub instance, open the URL that is pasted to stdout
in your favorite web browser. This will likely look something like
http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=xxx where xxx is your unique token

Once you have opened the JupyterHub instance, you should see a graphical
user interface. The Pyatoa, PySEP and SeisFlows repositories will be downloaded
and navigable in the file system on the left hand side of the window.

From inside the JupyterHub instance, click the 'Terminal' icon to open up a
terminal window, and run the following example command. Note, it's best to run
the example in a new directory to avoid muddling up the home directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir sf_sem2d_example
    cd sf_sem2d_example
    seisflows examples run 2

This example will download, configure and compile SPECFEM2D into your
JupyterHub instance, and then run a SeisFlows-Pyatoa-SPECFEM2D inversion
problem.


From the command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    Command line implementation does not currently work.

To run the SeisFlows SPECFEM2D example from the command line, we simply need
to point Docker to the image we just downloaded, and call the SeisFlows command
line tool. To run the help message:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run ghcr.io/seisscoped/pyatoa:nightly seisflows -h

Running the example should be as easy as:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run ghcr.io/seisscoped/pyatoa:nightly seisflows examples run 2

In the above example, SeisFlows automatically identifies the SPECFEM2D
installation within the Docker image and uses this as the external numerical
solver. All results will be output to your current working directory.


HPC example with Apptainer/Singularity
--------------------------------------

.. note::
    Section Under Construction

Apptainer/Singularity is a container system for high performance computers (HPC)
that allows Users to run container images on HPCs. You might want to use
Apptainer if you cannot download software using Conda on your HPC, or you simply
do not want to go through the trouble of downloading software on your system.

* Singularity on Chinook: 
  https://uaf-rcs.gitbook.io/uaf-rcs-hpc-docs/third-party-software/singularity
* Singularity on TACC:
  https://containers-at-tacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/singularity/
01.singularity_basics.html


.. note::
    This section was written working on TACC's Frontera, a SLURM based HPC.
    Instructions may differ depending on your Systems setup and workload
    manager. Because Singularity cannot be run on the Login nodes, the following
    code blocks are run in the `idev <https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/
    user-guide/running/#interactive-sessions-with-idev-and-srun>`__ interactive
    environment.

To download the required image on your system:

.. code-block:: bash

    module load tacc-singularity  # on TACC Frontera
    # module load singularity  # on UAF Chinook
    singularity pull seisflows.sif docker://ghcr.io/seisscoped/pyatoa:nightly

To run the SeisFlows help message

.. code-block:: bash

    singularity run seisflows.sif seisflows -h

To set your system to use Singularity, you just need to append '-singularity' to
an existing system subclass in the SeisFlows parameter file. For example, since
we are running on Frontera, we set our system to 'frontera-singularity'.

.. code-block:: bash

    seisflows setup  # create the 'parameters.yaml' file
    seisflows par system frontera-singularity  # set the system
    # ... set any other main modules here
    seisflows configure  # fill out the parameter file
    # ... edit your parameters here and then run SeisFlows
    singularity run ghcr.io/seisscoped/pyatoa:nightly seisflows submit
