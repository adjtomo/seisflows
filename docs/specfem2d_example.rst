Specfem2D Workstation Examples
==============================

SeisFlows comes with some **Specfem2D synthetic examples** to showcase
the software in action. These examples are meant to be run on a **local
machine** (tested on a Linux workstation running CentOS 7, and an Apple
Laptop running macOS 10.14.6).

The numerical solver we will use is:
`SPECFEM2D <https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem2d/>`__. We’ll
also be working in our ``seisflows``
`Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__ environment, see the
installation section on the home page for instructions on how to install
and activate the required Conda environment.

.. warning:: 
    If you do not have a compiled version of SPECFEM2D, then each example will attempt to automatically download and compile SPECFEM2D. This step may fail if you do not have software required by SPECFEM2D, if there are issues with the SPECFEM2D repository itself, or if the configuration and compiling steps fail. If you run any issues, it is recommended that you manually install and compile SPECFEM2D, and directly provide its path to this example problem using the -r or --specfem2d_repo flags (shown below).

Example #1: Homogenous Halfspace Inversion
------------------------------------------

Example #1 runs a 1-iteration synthetic inversion with 1 event and 1
station, used to illustrate misfit kernels and updated models in adjoint
tomography.

The starting/initial model (*MODEL_INIT*) and target/true model
(*MODEL_TRUE*) are used to generate synthetics and (synthetic) data,
respectively. Both models are homogeneous halfspace models defined by
velocity (Vp, Vs) and density (:math:`\rho`) with slightly varying P-
and S-wave velocity values (**INIT**: :math:`V_p`\ =5.8km/s,
:math:`V_s`\ =3.5km/s; **TRUE**: :math:`V_p`\ =5.9km/s,
:math:`V_s`\ =3.55km/s). Only Vp and Vs are updated during the example.

Misfit during Example #1 is defined by a ‘traveltime’ misfit using the
``Default`` preprocessing module. It also uses a ``gradient-descent``
optimization algorithm paired with a bracketing line search. No
smoothing/regularization is applied to the gradient.

    This is a [SPECFEM2D] [WORKSTATION] example, which will run an inversion to
    assess misfit between two homogeneous halfspace models with slightly different
    velocities. [1 events, 1 station, 1 iterations]. The tasks involved include:
    
    1. (optional) Download, configure, compile SPECFEM2D
    2. [Setup] a SPECFEM2D working directory
    3. [Setup] starting model from 'Tape2007' example
    4. [Setup] target model w/ perturbed starting model
    5. [Setup] a SeisFlows working directory
    6. [Run] the inversion workflow
    ================================================================================


Running the example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can either setup and run the example in separate tasks using the
``seisflows examples setup`` and ``seisflows submit`` commands, or by
directly running the example after setup using the ``examples run``
command (illustrated below).

Use the ``-r`` or ``--specfem2d_repo`` flag to point SeisFlows at an
existing SPECFEM2D/ repository (with compiled binaries) if available. If
not given, SeisFlows will automatically download, configure and compile
SPECFEM2D in your current working directory.

.. code:: bash

    # Run command with open variable to set SPECFEM2D path
    seisflows examples setup 1 -r ${PATH_TO_SPECFEM2D}
    seisflows submit
    
    # The following command is the same as above
    seisflows examples run 1 --specfem2d_repo ${PATH_TO_SPECFEM2D}

Running with MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have compiled SPECFEM2D with MPI, and have MPI installed and
loaded on your system, you can run this example with MPI. To do so, you
only need use the ``--with_mpi`` flag. By default SeisFlows will use
only 1 core, but you can choose the number of processors/tasks with the
``--nproc ${NPROC}`` flag. The example call runs example 1 with 4 cores.

.. code:: bash

    # Run Solver tasks with MPI on 4 cores
    seisflows examples run 1 -r ${PATH_TO_SPECFEM2D} --with_mpi --nproc 4

By default the example problems assume that your MPI executable is
``mpirun``. If for any reason ``mpirun`` is not what your system uses to
call MPI, you can use the ``--mpiexec ${MPIEXEC}`` flag to change that.

.. code:: bash

    seisflows examples run 1 -r ${PATH_TO_SPECFEM2D} --with_mpi --nproc 4 --mpiexec srun

We will not run the example in this notebook, however at this stage the
User should run one of the following commands above to execute the
example problem. A successfully completed example problem will end with
the following log messages:

    EXAMPLE COMPLETED SUCCESFULLY
    ================================================================================

    
Using the `working directory documentation page <working_directory.html>`__ you can figure out how to navigate around and look at the results of this small inversion problem. 

We will have a look at a few of the files and directories here. I've run the example problem in a scratch directory but your output directory should look the same.

.. code:: bash

    cd ~/sfexamples/example_1
    ls


.. parsed-literal::

    /home/bchow/Work/work/seisflows_example/example_1
    logs	parameters.yaml  sflog.txt    specfem2d
    output	scratch		 sfstate.txt  specfem2d_workdir


Understanding example outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``output/`` directory, we can see our starting/initial model
(*MODEL_INIT*), our true/target model (*MODEL_TRUE*) and the updated
model from the first iteration (*MODEL_01*). In addition, we have saved
the gradient generated during the first iteration (*GRADIENT_01*)
because we set the parameter ``export_gradient`` to True.

.. code:: bash

    # The output directory contains important files exported during a workflow
    ls output


.. parsed-literal::

    GRADIENT_01  MODEL_01  MODEL_INIT  MODEL_TRUE


.. code:: bash

    # A MODEL output directory contains model files in the chosen solver format. 
    # In this case, Fortran Binary from SPECFEM2D
    ls output/MODEL_01


.. parsed-literal::

    proc000000_vp.bin  proc000000_vs.bin


Plotting results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can plot the model and gradient files created during our workflow
using the ``seisflows plot2d`` command. The ``--savefig`` flag allows us
to save output .png files to disk. The following figure shows the
starting/initial homogeneous halfspace model in Vs.

.. note::
    Models and gradients can only be plotted when using `SPECFEM2D` as the chosen solver. Other solvers (e.g., SPECFEM3D and 3D_GLOBE) require external software (e.g., ParaView) to visualize volumetric quantities like models and gradients.

.. note::
    Because this docs page was made in a Jupyter Notebook, we need to use the IPython Image class to open the resulting .png file from inside the notebook. Users following along will need to open the figure using the GUI or command line tool.

.. code:: bash

    # Plot and open the initial homogeneous halfspace model
    seisflows plot2d MODEL_INIT vs --savefig m_init_vs.png
    Image(filename='m_init_vs.png') 


.. parsed-literal::

    Figure(707.107x707.107)




.. image:: images/specfem2d_example_files/specfem2d_example_19_1.png



We can also plot the gradient that was created during the adjoint
simulation. In this example we only have one source and one receiver, so
the gradient shows a “banana-doughnut” style kernel, representing
volumetric sensitivity of the measurement (waveform misfit) to changes
in model values.

.. code:: bash

    seisflows plot2d GRADIENT_01 vs_kernel --savefig g_01_vs.png
    Image(filename='g_01_vs.png') 


.. parsed-literal::

    Figure(707.107x707.107)




.. image:: images/specfem2d_example_files/specfem2d_example_21_1.png



Finally we can plot the updated model (*MODEL_01*), which is the sum of
the initial model and a scaled gradient. The gradient was scaled during
the line search, where we used a steepest-descent algorithm to reduce
the misfit between data and synthetics. Since we only have one
source-receiver pair in this workflow, the updated model shown below
almost exactly mimics the Vs kernel shown above.

.. code:: bash

    seisflows plot2d MODEL_01 vs --savefig m_01_vs.png
    Image(filename='m_01_vs.png') 


.. parsed-literal::

Closing thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Have a look at the `working directory documentation page <working_directory.html>`__ for more detailed explanations of how to navigate the SeisFlows working directory that was created during this example.

You can also run Example \#1 with more stations (up to 131), tasks/events (up to 25) and iterations (as many as you want!). Note that because this is a serial inversion, the compute time will scale with all of these values.

.. code:: bash

    # An example call for running Example 1 with variable number of stations, events and iterations
    seisflows examples run 1 --nsta 10 --ntask 5 --niter 2

Example #2: Checkerboard Inversion (w/ Pyaflowa & L-BFGS)
---------------------------------------------------------

Building on the foundation of the previous example, Example #2 runs a 2
iteration inversion with misfit quantification taken care of by the
``Pyaflowa`` preprocessing module, which uses the misfit quantification
package `Pyatoa <https://github.com/adjtomo/pyatoa>`__ under the hood.

Model updates are performed using an `L-BFGS nonlinear optimization
algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS>`__.
Example #2 also includes smoothing/regularization of the gradient. This
example more closely mimics a research-grade inversion problem.

.. note::
    This example is computationally more intense than the default version of Example \#1 as it uses multiple events and stations, and runs multiple iterations.

    checkerboard model. This example problem uses the [PYAFLOWA] preprocessing
    module and the [LBFGS] optimization algorithm. [4 events, 32 stations, 2
    iterations]. The tasks involved include:
    
    1. (optional) Download, configure, compile SPECFEM2D
    2. [Setup] a SPECFEM2D working directory

Run the example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the example with the same command as shown for Example 1.
Users following along will need to provide a path to their own
installation of SPECFEM2D using the ``-r`` flag.

.. code:: bash

    seisflows examples run 2 -r ${PATH_TO_SPECFEM2D}

Succesful completion of the example problem will end with a log message that looks similar to the following

Understanding example outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with Example #1, we can look at the output gradients and models to
visualize what just happenend under the hood. Be sure to read through
the output log messages as well, to get a better idea of what steps and
tasks were performed to generate these outputs.

.. code:: bash

    cd ~/sfexamples/example_2
    ls


.. parsed-literal::

    /home/bchow/Work/work/seisflows_example/example_2
    logs	parameters.yaml  sflog.txt    specfem2d
    output	scratch		 sfstate.txt  specfem2d_workdir


Running the ``plot2d`` command without any arguments is a useful way to
determine what model/gradient files are available for plotting.

.. code:: bash

    seisflows plot2d


.. parsed-literal::

                                         PLOT2D                                     
                                         //////

    GRADIENT_01
    GRADIENT_02
    MODEL_01
    MODEL_02
    MODEL_INIT
    MODEL_TRUE


Similarly, running ``plot2d`` with 1 argument will help determine what
quantities are available to plot

.. code:: bash

    seisflows plot2d MODEL_TRUE

Visualizing Initial and Target models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The starting model for this example is the same homogeneous halfspace
model shown in Example #1, with :math:`V_p`\ =5.8km/s and
:math:`V_s`\ =3.5km/s.

For this example, however, the target model is a checkerboard model with
fast and slow perturbations roughly equal to :math:`\pm10\%` of the
initial model. We can plot the model below to get a visual
representation of these perturbations, where **red==slow** and
**blue==fast**.

.. code:: bash

    seisflows plot2d MODEL_TRUE vs --savefig m_true_vs.png
    Image(filename='m_true_vs.png') 


.. parsed-literal::

    Figure(707.107x707.107)




.. image:: images/specfem2d_example_files/specfem2d_example_40_1.png



Visualizing the Gradient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can look at the gradients created during the adjoint simulations to
get an idea of how our inversion wanted to update the model. Gradients
tell us how to perturb our starting model (the homogeneous halfspace) to
best fit the data that was generated by our target model (the
checkerboard).

We can see that our gradient (Vs kernel) is characterized by large red
and blue blobs. The blue colors in the kernel tell us that the initial
model is too fast, while red colors tell us that the initial model is
too slow (that is, **red==too slow** and **blue==too fast**). This makes
sense if we look at the checkerboard target model above, where the
perturbation is slow (red color) the corresponding kernel tells us the
initial (homogeneous halfspace) model is too fast (blue color).

.. code:: bash

    seisflows plot2d GRADIENT_01 vs_kernel --savefig g_01_vs.png
    Image(filename='g_01_vs.png') 


.. parsed-literal::

    Figure(707.107x707.107)




.. image:: images/specfem2d_example_files/specfem2d_example_42_1.png



Visualizing the updated model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After two iterations, the updated model starts to take form. We can
clearly see that the lack of data coverage on the outer edges of the
model mean we do not see any appreciable update here, whereas the center
of the domain shows the strongest model updates which are starting to
resemble the checkerboard pattern shown in the target model.

With only 4 events and 2 iterations, we do not have quite enough
constraint to recover the sharp contrasts between checkers shown in the
Target model. We can see that data coverage, smearing and regularization
leads to more prominent slow (red) regions.

If we were to increase the number of events and iterations, will it help
our recovery of the target model? This task is left up to the reader!

Re-creating kernels from Tape et al. 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 2D checkerboard model and source-receiver configuration that runs in
this example come from the published work of `Tape et
al. (2007) <https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/168/3/1105/929373>`__.
Here, Tape et al. generate event kernels for a number of individual
events (`Figure
9 <https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/31726687/168-3-1105-fig009.jpeg>`__,
shown below). This exercise illustrates how kernel features change for a
simple target model (the checkerboard) depending on the chosen
source-receiver geometry.

An attentive reader will notice that the misfit kernel we generated
above looks very similar to Panel (h) in the figure below.

.. image:: images/reference_figures/tape_etal_2007_fig9.jpeg

The Event ID that generated each kernel is specified in the title of
each sub plot (e.g., Panel. (a) corresponds to Event #1). We can attempt
to re-create these kernels by choosing specific event IDs to run Example
2 with.

To specify the specific event ID, we can use the ``--event_id`` flag
when running Example 2. For this docs page we’ll choose Event #7, which
is represented by Panel (g) in the figure above.

.. note::
    Our choice of preprocessing module, misfit function, gradient smoothing length, nonlinear optimization algorithm, etc. will affect how each event kernel is produced, and consequently how much they differ from the published kernels shown above. We do not expect to perfectly match the event kernels above, but rather to see that first order structure is the same.

    # Run command with open variable to set SPECFEM2D path. Choose event_id==7 and only run 1 iteration
    seisflows examples run 2 -r ${PATH_TO_SPECFEM2D} --event_id 7 --niter 1

Comparing kernels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This workflow should run faster than Example #2 proper, because we are
only using 1 event and 1 iteration. In the same vein as above, we can
visualize the output gradient to see how well it matches with those
published in Tape et al.

.. code:: bash

    cd ~/sfexamples/example_2a
    ls


.. parsed-literal::

    /home/bchow/Work/work/seisflows_example/example_2a
    logs	parameters.yaml  sflog.txt    specfem2d
    output	scratch		 sfstate.txt  specfem2d_workdir


.. code:: bash

    seisflows plot2d GRADIENT_01 vs_kernel --save g_01_vs.png
    Image("g_01_vs.png")


.. parsed-literal::

    Figure(707.107x707.107)




.. image:: images/specfem2d_example_files/specfem2d_example_54_1.png



From the above figure we can see that the first order structure of our
Vs event kernel is very similar to Panel (g) from Figure 9 of Tape et
al. (2007). As mentioned, any differences between the kernel will be due
to the differences in the parameters available to us during the
inversion.

Creating all the other kernels shown in Figure 9 of Tape et al. is an
exercise left to the reader.

Example #3: En-masse Forward Simulations
----------------------------------------

SeisFlows is not just an inversion tool, it can also be used to simplify
workflows to run forward simulations using external numerical solvers.
In Example #3 we use SeisFlows to run en-masse forward simulations.

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Imagine a User who has a velocity model of a specific region (at any
scale). This User would like to run a number of forward simulations for
**N** events and **S** stations to generate **N** :math:`\times` **S**
synthetic seismograms. These synthetics may be used directly, or
compared to observed seismograms to understand how well the regional
velocity model characterizes actual Earth structure.

If **N** is large this effort may require a large number of manual
tasks, including the creation of working directories, editing submit
calls (if working on a cluster), and book keeping for files generated by
the external solver. SeisFlows is here to automate all of these tasks.

Running the example

    This is a [SPECFEM2D] [WORKSTATION] example, which will run forward simulations
    to generate synthetic seismograms through a homogeneous halfspace starting
    model. This example uses no preprocessing or optimization modules. [10 events,
    25 stations] The tasks involved include:
    
    1. (optional) Download, configure, compile SPECFEM2D
    2. [Setup] a SPECFEM2D working directory
    3. [Setup] starting model from 'Tape2007' example
    4. [Setup] a SeisFlows working directory
    5. [Run] the forward simulation workflow

Understanding example outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example does not produce gradients or updated models, only
synthetic seismograms. We can view these seismograms using the
``seisflows plotst`` command, which is used to quickly plot synthetic
seismograms (using ObsPy under the hood).

.. code:: bash

    cd ~/sfexamples/example_3
    ls


.. parsed-literal::

    /home/bchow/Work/work/seisflows_example/example_3
    logs	parameters.yaml  sflog.txt    specfem2d
    output	scratch		 sfstate.txt  specfem2d_workdir


In this example, we have set the ``export_traces`` parameter to
**True**, which tells SeisFlows to store synthetic waveforms generated
during the workflow in the ``output/`` directory. Under the hood,
SeisFlows is copying all synthetic seismograms from the Solver’s
``scratch/`` directory, to a more permanent location.

.. code:: bash

    # The `export_traces` parameter tells SeisFlows to save synthetics after each round of forward simulations
    seisflows par export_traces  


.. parsed-literal::

    export_traces: True


.. code:: bash

    # Exported traces will be stored in the `output` directory
    ls output


.. parsed-literal::

    MODEL_INIT  solver


.. code:: bash

    # Synthetics will be stored on a per-event basis, and in the format that the external solver created them
    ls output/solver/
    echo
    ls output/solver/001/syn
